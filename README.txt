MyVBA is a collection of tools I use across a whole bunch of projects to make routine problem-solving in VBA
just a bit quicker, more natural and make the code more readable. Some of the tools herein are mainly to help
with debugging, version control, and other development tasks within the VBA IDE. Other tools are here to make
VBA coding somewhat more like coding in other dynamic scripting languages.
